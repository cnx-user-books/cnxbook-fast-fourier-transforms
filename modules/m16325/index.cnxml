    <para id="id2255538">The development of fast algorithms usually consists of using special
properties of the algorithm of interest to remove redundant or unnecessary
operations of a direct implementation. Because of the periodicity,
symmetries, and orthogonality of the basis functions and the special
relationship with convolution, the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) has enormous capacity for improvement of its arithmetic efficiency.</para>
    <para id="id2255548">There are four main approaches to formulating efficient DFT <link target-id="bid0"/> algorithms. The first two break a DFT into multiple shorter ones.
This is done in <link document="m16326">Multidimensional Index Mapping</link> by using an index map and in
<link document="m16327">Polynomial Description of Signals</link> by polynomial reduction. The third is <link document="m16330">Factoring the Signal Processing Operators</link> which factors the DFT operator (matrix) into sparse factors.
<link document="m16328">The DFT as Convolution or Filtering</link> develops a method which converts a prime-length DFT
into cyclic convolution. Still another approach is interesting where, for certain cases, the evaluation of the DFT can be posed recursively
as evaluating a DFT in terms of two half-length DFTs which are each in turn
evaluated by a quarter-length DFT and so on.</para>
    <para id="id2255580">The very important computational complexity theorems of
Winograd are stated and briefly discussed in <link document="m16333">Winograd's Short DFT Algorithms</link>. The
specific details and evaluations of the Cooley-Tukey FFT and
Split-Radix FFT are given in <link document="m16334">The Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm</link>, and PFA and WFTA are covered in <link document="m16335">The Prime Factor and Winograd Fourier Transform Algorithms</link>. A short discussion of high speed
convolution is given in <link document="m16339">Convolution Algorithms</link>, both for its own
importance, and its theoretical connection to the DFT.
We also present the chirp, Goertzel, QFT, NTT, SR-FFT, Approx FFT,
Autogen, and programs to implement some of these.
</para>
    <para id="element-755">Ivan Selesnick gives a short introduction in <link document="m16333">Winograd's Short DFT Algorithms</link> to using Winograd's 
techniques to give a highly structured development of short prime
length FFTs and describes a program that will automaticlly write these
programs.  Markus Pueschel presents his ``Algebraic Signal Processing" in
<link document="m16331">DFT and FFT: An Algebraic View</link> on describing the various FFT algorithms.  And Steven Johnson 
describes the FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) in <link document="m16336">Implementing FFTs in Practice</link> 
</para><para id="id2255602">The organization of the book represents the various approaches
to understanding the FFT and to obtaining efficient computer programs.
It also shows the intimate relationship between theory and implementation
that can be used to real advantage. The disparity in material devoted
to the various approaches represent the tastes of this author, not any
intrinsic differences in value.</para>
    <para id="id2255612">A fairly long list of references is given but it is impossible to
be truly complete. I have referenced the work that I have used and that I am aware of. The collection of computer programs is also somewhat idiosyncratic. They are in Matlab and Fortran because that is what I have used over the years. They also are written primarily for their educational value although some are quite efficient. There is excellent content in the Connexions book by Doug Jones <link target-id="bid1"/>.</para>
